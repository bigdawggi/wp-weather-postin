Saves current weather information when a post is published.  Weather information is then displayed after the post's contents.

== Description ==

Weather Postin' retrieves the current weather provided from [RSS Weather](http://www.rssweather.com/ "Source of weather information") when your post is published.  After that, when you view your posts the weather conditions will display at the end of your post.  This does not alter the original text of the post; it is only displayed at run-time.

Please note, that posts prior to activation will not have weather associated with them.  Yes, obvious, but worth saying. :o)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `post_weather` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Set options (zip code and text color) under "plugins/Weather Postin' Configuration" menu.
4. Write and publish a post to see the weather!

	When updating you will need to deactivate and reactivate the plugin.
